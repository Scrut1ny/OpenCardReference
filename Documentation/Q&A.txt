Q3. What is AVS?

Address Verification System (AVS) is a fraud prevention measure used by payment processors to verify the billing address provided by the cardholder during a transaction. The AVS system checks the numeric portion of the street address, the zip or postal code, and in some cases, the name of the cardholder. If the information matches, the transaction is approved, and if the information doesn't match, the transaction may be declined or flagged for review. AVS helps prevent fraudulent transactions by ensuring that the billing address provided by the cardholder matches the address on file with the card issuer.

(Note: method is posted on March 16)

Login into Skype account and call on Magic number +18005xx5633 (masked). You will connect to voice mail (lady’s voice). Start by entering the credit card number, and voice mail lady will stop automatically.

After that enter Expiry date of a card like 01 16 (mm: yy format).

If your credit card is live then voice mail lady will speak like “Thank you for calling, we really appreciate your business, since u are a 1st-time caller we would like to connect you .. blah blah” then just hang the call.

But if the credit card is used and voice mail lady speak like “Ohh I’m sorry please re-enter your credit card number now” then the card is dead. You can repeat the same process as many time you want.
