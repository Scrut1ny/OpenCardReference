    4        = The first digit of the credit card number is the Major Industry Identifier (MII), which identifies the category of the 
	         card issuer. In this case, the MII is 4, which indicates that the card was issued by a banking and financial institution.
			   
    2668     = The first six digits of the credit card number are the Issuer Identification Number (IIN), which identifies the specific 
	         card issuer. The IIN is also known as the Bank Identification Number (BIN) or the Prefix. In this example, the IIN is 2668, which is assigned to Wells Fargo Bank.
			   
    413      = The next one to six digits (depending on the card issuer) are the Account Number. This is the unique number assigned to
               the cardholder's account. In this example, the Account Number is 413.
			   
    64979405 = The remaining digits are the Cardholder Account Number, which identifies the specific cardholder's account. This number 
	         can vary in length depending on the card issuer, but is typically 10-12 digits long. In this example, the Cardholder Account Number is 6497 9405.

It's important to note that credit card numbers can vary in length and structure depending on the card issuer and the type of 
card (e.g. Visa, Mastercard, American Express, etc.). The above explanation is just one example of a credit card number.

Credit card numbers, also known as Primary Account Numbers (PAN), typically have 16 digits. Each of these digits has a specific
meaning that helps identify the card issuer and the account information. Here is an explanation of each digit:

- The first digit identifies the major industry identifier (MII). This can help identify the type of institution that issued the card.
  For example, a digit of 1 or 2 indicates that the card was issued by an airline or other industry, while a digit of 3 or 4 indicates 
  that it was issued by a financial institution.

- The next five to six digits represent the issuer identification number (IIN) or bank identification number (BIN). This identifies the 
  financial institution that issued the card, such as a bank or credit union.

- The seventh to twelfth digit is the account number. This unique number is assigned by the issuer and identifies the specific account associated with the card.

- The thirteenth digit is the check digit. It is used to verify the validity of the credit card number using a mathematical algorithm
  called the Luhn algorithm. This helps ensure that the credit card number is valid and not a random sequence of digits.

- The last three to four digits are the card verification value (CVV) or card security code (CSC). These are typically located on the 
  back of the card and are used as an additional layer of security to prevent fraud. The CVV or CSC is not stored on the magnetic 
  stripe or chip of the card and is only printed on the card itself.
