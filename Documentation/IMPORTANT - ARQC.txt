ARQC tokens are unique cryptographic codes generated by credit and debit cards to authenticate transactions. Each token is valid for only one transaction and is used to verify the card's validity. Once the transaction is approved, the ARQC token cannot be reused.

When using a regular card, a new ARQC token is generated for each transaction on the day it occurs. Generating ARQC tokens ahead of time ensures that they are valid for use on the day of the transaction.

1 ARQC tokens = 1 Transaction
